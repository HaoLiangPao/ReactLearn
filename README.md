# Learning React from scratch 

This repository is a `project-based` learning package for `beingers` in web development who wants to learn React **from scratch**. 

It contains projects I created using Rreact and different APIs along with some front-end frameworks (Bootstrap, Materialize).

## 1. Purpose of this project

I created all the projects following [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/ "Brad Traversy")' course in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/ "Brad's Courses on Udemy"). I made some personal changes and cleared the structure a bit for future reference. 

`A lot of comments` are saved between the lines, which makes the code easy to understand. `ReadMe.md` files are included in each projects, where relationships between the files, classes, functions are explained.

I want to share it with all beginners who want to be a full-stack developer but need some projects to get started. 

## 2. Great to have knowledge

I never used React before, as well as other frameworks (either front-end or back-end). As a result, I found it more difficult to learn compared to HTML/CSS. HTML and CSS do not require any settings of the environment and can be run directly in the broswer. However, a lot more files are collaborating when dealing with React. So I have some words to say to beginners like me:

1. Make sure to understand concepts:
   1. HTML
   2. CSS
   3. **JavaScripts**
      1. Arrow Functions
      2. Promises / Asynchronus Requests
      3. Destructring
      4. **Components** / **States**
      5. Spread Operator
      6. High Order Array Functions
         1. map()
         2. filter()
         3. forEach()
2. Try to know more about concepts:
   1. NPM
   2. Back-end APIs
   3. Front-end Framworks
