## Explanation

### Process of running files

The react application runs `ReactDom.render()` function (imported from `react-dom`) in `index.js`, which imports `App` component from `app.js`. All three states are imported in `app.js`, along with all components (both custom components and components imported from libraries). The components highligheted in red are external components imported from libraries, where other components are customed components. Green highlighted components are rendered in condition. For instance, only one page component a time will be rendered in React application on certain condition. The `PrivateRoute` component is accesible only when the user successfully logged in, which prevents other users to see contacts doesn't belong to them.

### Some terminologies

State:

Similar to props, it contain certain properties in object which can be used for updating an component. However, it is private and fully controlled by the component.

Context:

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but this can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

Reducer:

As it is a app-level state, all changes of state variables happens here in reducer and it will change components corresponding to the changes. Alogorithums that decide which components need to be rerendered also applied here after reducer changes the state. In this projects, reducers were seperated to split the "updating state" functionality from state files to increase the readability. 

> *How do `Context` & `Reducer` work together?*

> *It is a way to achive app-level state management. Things are sent down from the state through the reducer and things are sent up through actions. So if we want to add a user, we <u>call an action</u> and then that <u>will dispatch to the reducer</u> and <u>reducer will decide how to manipulate</u> the rest of the application (the rest of the components in UI).*

Component:

A React **Component** is a template. A blueprint. A global definition. This can be either a **function** or a **class** (with a render function). It returns element.

Element:

A React **Element** is what gets **returned** from components. Itâ€™s an object that virtually describes the DOM nodes that a component represents. With a _function component_, this element is the object that the function returns. With a _class component_, the element is the object that the componentâ€™s `render()` function returns. React elements are not what we see in the browser. They are just objects in memory and we canâ€™t change anything about them.
